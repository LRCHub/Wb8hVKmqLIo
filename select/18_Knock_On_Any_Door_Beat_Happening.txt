Knock on any door
Are they as lonesome as me
Knock on any door
How can they be

They don't have you
To not be there
When I call out

Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door

Your wish is my command
Breaks the spell on my brown
Lift your treasured hand
I'd be so proud
To share with you this night's remains
The rise and fall

Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Door

Grant me one last wish
Strike a match and set me free
Grant me this last kiss
Oh can't you see

I'll be long gone from distant bonds
The flame is out

Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door

Knock on any door
Are they as lonely as me
Knock on any door
How can they be

They don't have you
To not be there
When I call out
Knock on any door

Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door

Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
Knock on any door
