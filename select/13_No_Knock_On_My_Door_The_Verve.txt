She knew my feelings were jangled and frayed
She took me into a wind blown alley way
She showed me a world a boy should see
I'll thank her 'til the day that I die

So, here we go
No knock on my door
Believe it 'til you see what living has done to me
And I'm sure that I need holding

I took her to a room, and I showed her myself
She made me feel proud that I would stand for
There's nothing that this girl wouldn't do for me
For that I've got to thank her, and I mean it

So, here we go
A face in the crowd
Jump up and jump down
Baby, can you see through me?

Sure, I've been here before
No knock on my door
No love in the shadow
Baby, please be my star

Sure, I've seen it before
No knock on my door
Love in the shadow
Can be painful, I know

Cry, I cry every night
I need to hold you tight
Oh, can you see me knocking down your door?

Sure, there's times I have hoped
There's times I have dreamed
Oh, but it seems that much to me to me, my love
I never seemed to it out, my love

I'm shakin'
Yeah, I'm shakin'
And I'm shakin'
